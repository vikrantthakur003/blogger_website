        <p class="post-text">
            A mobile phone (also known as a hand phone, cell phone, or cellular telephone) is a small portable radio
            telephone.

            Mobile phones in the 1950s through 1970s were large and heavy, and most were built into cars. In the late
            20th century technology improved so people could carry their phones with ease.

            Although Dr. Martin Cooper from Motorola made the first call using a mobile phone in 1973 (using a handset
            weighing 2 kilograms), it did not use the type of cellular mobile phone network that we use today.

            The first cellular mobile phone networks were created in 1979 in Japan. Now almost all urban areas, and many
            country areas, are covered by mobile phone networks.

        <h2 class="sub-heading"> Technology</h2>
        <p class="post-text">A cell phone combines technologies, mainly telephone, radio, and computer. Most also have a
            digital camera inside.

            Cell phones work as two-way radios. They send electromagnetic microwaves from base station to base station.
            The waves are sent through antennas. This is called wireless communication.

            Early cell telephones used analog networks. They became rare late in the 20th century. Modern phones use
            digital networks.

            The first digital networks are also known as second generation, or 2G, technologies. The most used digital
            network is GSM (Global System for Mobile communication). It is used mainly in Europe and Asia, while CDMA
            (Code-Division Multiple Access) networks are mainly used in North America. The difference is in
            communication protocol. Other countries like Japan have different 2G protocols. A few 2G networks are still
            used. 3G are more common, and many places have 4G.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">How mobile phones work</h2>
        <p class="post-text">When a mobile phone is switched on, its radio receiver finds a nearby mobile phone network
            base station, and its transmitter sends a request for service. Computers in the base station check if the
            phone is allowed to use the network. The base station covers an area called a cell. A phone can move between
            different cells, but will only communicate with one cell at a time. This is why mobile communications are
            sometimes called cellular communications.

            Once connected to a station, the mobile phone can make calls. Because the network knows that the phone is
            connected to that particular cell, it can also route calls to the mobile phone. Sometimes the radio
            connection to the cell is lost, for example when you go underground. This means the phone cannot make or
            receive calls until the connection is made again.

        </p>


        <h2 class="sub-heading">Smartphones</h2>
        <p class="post-text">A majority of new mobile phones from the 21st century are smartphones. These phones are
            basically small computers. Besides calling, they can be used for email, browsing the internet, showing local
            maps, playing music and games, and many other functions that computers can perform.

            Most smartphones run a common mobile operating system. This allows developers to make mobile apps that work
            on many different phones without needing to change the code. Examples of smartphones include Apple's iPhone
            (which uses iOS software) and Samsung's Galaxy series, one of many phones that use the Android platform made
            by Google.
